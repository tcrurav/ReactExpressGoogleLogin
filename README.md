# React (frontend) and Express (backend) Example using OAuth2 with Login

This project is just a project example to learn how to use OAuth2 Login with Google using ReactJS (frontend) and Express (backend).

This example is just a copy from https://www.sitepoint.com/google-auth-react-express/

## OAuth2 explained with 2 Diagrams

This diagram has been taken from https://blog.prototypr.io/how-to-build-google-login-into-a-react-app-and-node-express-api-821d049ee670. Is a good way to understand the OAuth2 flow used in this project.

This other flow diagram is taken from https://medium.com/javarevisited/jwt-and-social-authentication-using-spring-boot-90e4faaa9204. This project doesn't implement this diagrama. But I include it here because It's a good way to understand the following step you will have to do when you implement OAuth2 in a more complete way:
